    "getPhaseNoise with simple bipartite approach.  This algorithm should theoretically be the best possible way we can take measurements using our measurement scheme.  I am treating our vector as a bipartite graph where each even entry of the vector is on one side and the odd entries are on the other side of teh graph.  Any valid choice of a (i.e. an odd choice of a) will link an vertex of one side to the other.  Because we cannot use even a, we cannot connect even vertices to even or odd to odd.  Thus this graph is bipartite.  However we can also connect any even entry to all odd vertices and vice versa.  This is because there are N/2 odd vertices and there are N/2 valid choices of a, and each choice of a will connect an even vertex to a unique odd vertex.  Thus the entries of one side are fully connected to the entries of the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that the ultimately optimal measurement scheme is quite simple.  We get a better estimate for an entry when the entry we are measuring from has a larger magnitude, because we divide the noise term of the relative phase by the phase of this entry.  Then the best way to measure any even vertex is to make the measurement from the largest odd vertex.  Similarly the best way to measure any odd vertex is from the largest even vertex.  So what we do is:\n",
    "* take a magnitude measurement of all the vertices, say the largest magnitude entry is even\n",
    "* use the largest magnitude vertex (the even one) to get a relative phase measurement for each odd vertex on the other side of the bipartite graph, giving an estimate for all odd entries\n",
    "* use the largest magnitude odd vertex along with its estimated phase to estimate each of the even vertices other than the vertex we started from\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce an estimate for the entire vector.  It is optimal because any relative phase measurement that is not FROM the largest even or odd vertex will produce an estimate for the phase of that entry that is less optimal than it otherwise could have been if the measurment was used more wisely.  \n",

This works by appending 0's to the vector to make a new vector whos length is a vector of two, and \"forgetting\" these extra entries when I return x_hat in the end.  I do technically now make more measurements than I should as I estimate the new entries that I create, but this shouldn't really cause any problems because in reality, we just wouldn't make those measurements.

This is mainly because it looks nicer and because I can treat those as finished methods and not mess with them any further.\n",

I spent an extensive amount of time working with Mixon's code to print all of Mixon's noise values to a document that can be read into Python.  At first I was only taking in the noise values for the intensity measurements, which was three times the size of the vector.  But then I also got all of the noise values from each measurement used for polarization.  The number of measurements and thus the number of noise values is quite significant.  For N=8, the number of measurements is around 300.  For N=128, it is about 5,000.  I only use N + 4*(N-1) measurements, i.e. about 5N measurements per run through the algorithm.  They use about 40N measurements.  Thus to compare to their algorithm, I should repeat mine about 8 times.  The only issue with this is that they claim to use O(NlogN) measurements, but it appears their measurements scale with O(N).  I should investigate this further. \n",
