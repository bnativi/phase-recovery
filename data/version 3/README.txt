Includes (hopefully) all of the signal values and all of the noise from every measurement used by Mixon, including both intensity and nonintensity measurements (there is not actual distinction between these two).

However, it turns out the noise values are not correct here, they are too large.  I forgot to multiply them by sigma/sqrt(2).
